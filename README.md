# Octave Scattered Image Toolkit

A toolkit consisting of various functions for the processing, interpolation, analysis and testing of scattered images and data.

I've called this project the scattered image toolkit because I mainly work on bivariate data `f(x, y) = z`, which have been irregularly sampled and so most of my functions either operate on x, y, z, scattered coordinates, or images.
