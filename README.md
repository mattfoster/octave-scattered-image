# Octave Scattered Image Toolkit

A toolkit consisting of various functions for the processing, interpolation, analysis and testing of scattered images and data.

I've called this project because I mainly work on bivariate data f(x, y) = z, and so most of my functions either operate on x, y, z, triples, or images.
